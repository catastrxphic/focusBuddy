      The ability to study effectively is a significant challenge faced by students. In response to this, we developed a tool aimed at enhancing focus and academic performance by utilizing Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs). This project outlines the development and implementation of our project, <i>"Focus Buddy,"</i> a web application designed to assist students in optimizing their study periods through the analysis of neural data.

### Data Collection

The initial phase involved collecting neural data from a headband equipped with BCI technology. This headband records brain activity and transmits the data to our AI neural network for analysis.

### Algorithm Development

The second phase focused on developing algorithms to sort and process the neural data. These algorithms handle anomalies such as user movement and ensure the accuracy of the focus data.

### Web Application Development

The final phase involved creating a web application where users can visualize their focus data. The application displays graphs of neural focus data points, including the minimum and maximum focus values over specified study periods.

## Challenges

### Technical Limitations

One significant challenge was that the headband only connected to Android devices. Additionally, due to time constraints, we were unable to implement machine learning algorithms to train on individual focus activities.

### Data Handling

Another challenge was the complexity of collecting, sorting, and analyzing neural data. Ensuring accurate predictions of focus periods required meticulous data processing and integration into the web application.

## Results

Despite the challenges, we successfully:
1. Collected and processed neural data using BCIs.
2. Developed algorithms to handle data anomalies.
3. Created a functional web application that visualizes focus data.

## Accomplishments

We are particularly proud of our ability to work with complex neural data and create a user-friendly web application. Our team effectively divided tasks based on individual skills, fostering a collaborative environment that enhanced the project's success.

## Lessons Learned

The project provided valuable learning experiences, particularly in terms of:
1. Developing technical skills in data processing and web development.
2. Enhancing teamwork and collaboration through a mentee-mentor relationship.
3. Understanding the intricacies of using BCIs for data collection and analysis.

## Future Work

Future improvements for Focus Buddy include:
1. **Enhanced Focus Reports:** Displaying topics where users had low focus percentages to help them review these topics during less distracted times.
2. **User Interface Improvements:** Enhancing the user interface to improve usability and user experience.
3. **Customization Options:** Adding personalized backgrounds and designs for the timer screen to increase user engagement.

## Conclusion

Focus Buddy leverages Brain-Computer Interfaces to provide students with valuable insights into their study habits. By analyzing neural data, the tool helps students optimize their study periods, making studying more efficient and less stressful. Our project demonstrates the potential of BCIs in educational applications and sets the stage for future innovations in this field.
